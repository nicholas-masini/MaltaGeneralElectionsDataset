# Maltese General Elections Dataset
An updated dataset containing information and statistics of each candidate's performance in every General Election in Malta, starting from 1921 up till present day.

<br>

The dataset was originally built by the University of Malta for a project. The dataset can be used for data analysis, mining and extraction. The original version only contained records up to 2013. By using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) in Python, a web scraper was written to extract the data out of the [Government Electoral Commission Portal](https://electoral.gov.mt/ElectionResults/General) and the data was appended to the original dataset. A total of **682** records were added.

The Web Scraping Script can be found in the *web_scraper* folder.
